        <li><a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Quicksilver" target="_blank">Pietro Maximoff</a>:
        Also known as Quicksilver, Pietro is Wanda's twin brother. He fought alongside his sister Wanda and the Avengers
        in the battle of Sokovia in Avengers:Age of Ultron, but eventually lost his life protecting Hawkeye who was shielding
        a child, after Ultron hijacked the Avengers Quinjet and began shooting at civilians.</li>
        <li><a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_America#Avengers_Civil_War" target="_blank">Steve Rogers</a>: Better known as
        Captain America, recruited Wanda and several others to join the Avengers. Due to events that occured in Sokovia, and later in Lagos,
        government oversight decided to step in, and have all nations, including the United States, sign a contracted called the Sovokia Accords,
        in order to regulate superheroes, and subject the Avengers' actions to the approval of a United Nations panel. Captain America refused to
        sign. Unsure of signing the accords, and afraid for her safety, Wanda was later taken to a facility, where she was held and guarded by
        Vision, but then rescued by Hawkeye, who was sent by Captain America. After the clash of the Avengers, Wanda and others were captured
        and imprisoned, but later rescued by Captain America himself.</li>
        <li><a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Hawkeye#Helping_Scarlet_Witch" target="_blank">Clint Barton</a>: Also known as
        Hawkeye, is an Avenger responsible for giving Wanda the strength to become an Avenger. During the battle of Sokovia, Hawkeye saves Wanda, and hides
        her in a building after being overwhelmed by all the attacks from Ultrons sentries. Once in the building, Wanda begins to experince a panic
        attack which prevents her from continuing to fight. Hawkeye sees this, and reassures her that she can stay where she is, and he will send her
        brother for her, or she can be an Avenger, and fight with the rest. Proving that Hawkeyes words were effective, Wanda decides to step out and
        fight off Ultrons sentries, thus solidifying her role as an Avenger.</li>
